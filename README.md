# bcc3.1_stl

STL Implementation for Borland C++ compiler from 1992 written as a utility library for an OS project at School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade in 2016.

BCC 3.1 is very old, but it provides a simple way of tempering with interrupt routines on DOS which makes it a suitable tool for teaching OS courses.

Feel free to contribute tests and comments and expand the library for the future generations which will be doing similar projects using BCC 3.1 at University of Belgrade or other universities.
